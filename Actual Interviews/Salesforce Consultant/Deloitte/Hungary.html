<ol>
<li>Tell me about yourself?</li>
Shortly tell the Interviewer about yourself, your background, your story, your experiences.

<li>How did you come to know about Salesforce?</li>
Your Salesforce journey.

<li> How did you study for your first Admin certification?</li>
Tell the interviewer your journey for studying about Salesforce, resources used (Udemy,Trailhead,communities,etc.)
You can tell about the SF bootcamp.
Do not say that you studied dumps for tests, instead say you used Quizlets to help you prepare for exams.

<li> What attracted you the most about Salesforce?</li>
</ol>

Be honest, tell the interviewer what really caught your attention, and why you started learning about Salesforce. Tell
an example of the process, you liked the most.
Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years? Could be related to your Salesforce journey.
Prepare your actual goals for the future, and what you want to achieve. Become a better Administrator, Developer,
Consultant, etc and why?
Do you know about the Agile system (Scrum)? What is the difference between Scrum and Kanban?
Specifically for Career Changers: Why are you changing from your previous ex. Finance background to IT? Or could be the
general question: Why did you choose IT?
Be prepared to answer this question. Try to really show why you want to change your career drastically? What are the
reasons?
Similarly: another question can be:
Why should we hire you?
This is very important, as you have no real experience. You have to stand out from other applicants who have 2-3 years
of experience.
Prepare to tell a story, persuade your interviewer, grab their attention.
What is your favorite feature of Salesforce?
Do you have any experience with user testing?
How do you evaluate the stories (tasks)?
Tell about the Agile experience

General TIPS
Check for actual Salesforce Mock Interviews (ex. SF Chef on Youtube :) )
Try to find sample Interview questions specifically to your Salesforce position (though you still need to be able to
answer general questions about Admin)
Practice what you will say at Interview (Open a camera on your laptop for example, and Practice before you get
confident).
Prepare examples of automation tools and be able to explain it (approval process, workflow, process builder, flows)
Know the company you are applying to (find more information about it online)
Know about your Interviewer if you can ( maybe you can find her/him on Linkedin, Facebook and find common interests. It
will be helpful to know.)
Prepare questions, after Interview you will ask these questions (generally these are what interests you the most about
your current role,team, company,etc.)
